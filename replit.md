## Overview

MBTILove is a web application focused on MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) personality-based compatibility and relationship guidance. The application provides users with comprehensive compatibility analysis, personality insights, and relationship advice based on MBTI types. It's designed as a multilingual platform supporting English, Korean, and Japanese languages.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Design preferences: 
- Dark navigation menu for better text visibility
- Romantic/soft background images to reduce harsh feeling
- Narrower content width for better readability
- Multi-language support with properly translated content (not just interface)

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: The application uses vanilla web technologies without frameworks
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Content is dynamically managed through JavaScript without page reloads
- **Component-Based Structure**: Modular JavaScript classes handle different aspects of functionality
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for mobile-first responsive layouts

### Styling Architecture
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Extensive use of CSS variables for consistent theming
- **Design System**: Predefined color palette, typography, shadows, and spacing
- **Gradient-Based Design**: Modern gradient backgrounds and visual elements
- **Google Fonts Integration**: Inter and Poppins fonts for typography

### JavaScript Architecture
- **Class-Based Organization**: Main application logic organized in ES6 classes
- **Module Pattern**: Separate files for different concerns (language, MBTI data, main app)
- **Event-Driven**: DOM event handling for user interactions
- **Local Storage**: Browser storage for user preferences and data persistence

## Key Components

### 1. Language Management System
- **Multi-language Support**: English, Korean, and Japanese
- **Dynamic Translation**: Runtime language switching without page reload
- **Persistent Preferences**: Language selection stored in localStorage
- **Translation Framework**: Structured translation system with key-value pairs

### 2. MBTI Compatibility Engine
- **Compatibility Matrix**: Predefined compatibility scores between all MBTI type combinations
- **Scoring System**: Percentage-based compatibility ratings (54-98%)
- **Relationship Insights**: Descriptive titles and analysis for each pairing
- **Bidirectional Matching**: Handles type combinations in both directions

### 3. Interactive Assessment System
- **Balance Questions**: Personality assessment through scenario-based questions
- **Type Determination**: Logic to derive MBTI dimensions (E/I, N/S, F/T, P/J)
- **Progressive Interface**: Step-by-step question flow
- **Result Analytics**: Answer tracking and personality profile generation

### 4. User Interface Components
- **Tab Navigation**: Multi-section interface for different features
- **Dating Styles**: Personality-based relationship advice
- **Responsive Cards**: Mobile-optimized content presentation
- **Interactive Elements**: Buttons, forms, and dynamic content updates

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Users select language, answer questions, or check compatibility
2. **Event Handling**: JavaScript classes capture and process user actions
3. **Data Processing**: MBTI algorithms calculate compatibility or determine personality types
4. **Content Update**: DOM manipulation updates the interface with results
5. **Persistence**: Important preferences saved to localStorage
6. **Translation**: Content dynamically translated based on language selection

## External Dependencies

### CDN Resources

### Performance Considerations
- **Minimal Dependencies**: No heavy frameworks or libraries
- **Efficient CSS**: Custom properties reduce stylesheet size
- **Local Storage**: Reduces server requests for user preferences
- **Responsive Images**: Optimized for different screen sizes

### Scalability Considerations
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to add new MBTI types or features
